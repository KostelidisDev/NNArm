# NNArm

This MATLAB project implements a neural network-based control system for a robotic arm using three different neural control strategies: Neural Network Predictive Control, NARMA-L2 Control, and Model-Reference Control. The controllers are designed and simulated using MATLAB’s Neural Network Toolbox and Simulink.

# Description

NNArm is a MATLAB/Simulink-based project for controlling a robotic arm using advanced neural network control techniques. The aim of the project is to implement, simulate, and compare multiple neural control strategies for precise and adaptive trajectory tracking of a robotic manipulator.
